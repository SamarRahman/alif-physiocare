    <h1>Joint Relief: Information & Treatment</h1><br>

    <section class="introduction"><br>
        <h2>What is Joint Pain?</h2><br>
        <p>Joints form the connections between bones in places such as your knees, elbows, shoulders, and hips. They provide support and help you move. Any damage to the joints from disease or injury can interfere with your movement and cause pain.

Joint pain can affect any part of your body, from your ankles and feet to your shoulders and hands. The most likely joints to have pain are the:
<ul>
    <li>
 <h3>Shoulders: </h3> The ball-and-socket joint allows for a wide range of motion but is also prone to injuries like rotator cuff tears and dislocations.
    </li>
    <li>
 <h3> Elbows:</h3> The hinge joint enables bending and straightening of the arm, but repetitive motions can lead to conditions like tennis elbow.
    </li>
    <li> <h3> knees: </h3> The largest joint in the body, it supports much of your weight and is susceptible to injuries such as ligament tears and meniscus injuries.</li>
    <li>
        <h3>Hips:</h3>
        The hip joint is a strong ball-and-socket joint that supports your body weight and enables walking, running, and other movements. It is susceptible to conditions such as arthritis, bursitis, and injuries from overuse or trauma.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Spine:</h3>
        The spine consists of multiple joints between vertebrae, allowing flexibility and movement. Joint pain in the spine can result from conditions like arthritis, herniated discs, or injuries, often leading to back pain and stiffness.
    </li>
    <li>
        <h3>Hands and Feet:</h3>
        The joints in the hands and feet are small but essential for daily activities and mobility. Conditions such as arthritis, repetitive strain, or injuries can cause pain, stiffness, and swelling, affecting grip strength, dexterity, and walking ability.
    </li>
</ul>

<br> Pain can affect one or more joints. Some people feel more joint pain in the morning, which improves when they get moving. Others have more pain after they’re active. Often, the pain comes with swelling and inflammation, stiffness, and loss of movement in the joint.</p>

    <section class="symptoms">
        <h2>What are the symptoms of joint pain?</h2> <br>
