            What is Posture Correction?<br>
        </h2>
        Posture correction is the practice of improving and maintaining proper body alignment and positioning to promote overall health and well-being. Good posture involves aligning the body in a way that minimizes strain on muscles, ligaments, and joints while maximizing efficiency and comfort. Poor posture can lead to various health issues, including back pain, neck pain, headaches, and reduced mobility. Posture correction techniques may include exercises, stretches, ergonomic adjustments, and lifestyle changes to help individuals achieve and maintain optimal posture throughout their daily. <br> <br>

            <li>Rounded Shoulders: This is characterized by the shoulders rolling forward, often due to prolonged sitting or poor ergonomics.</li>
            <li>Kyphosis: An excessive outward curve of the upper back, leading to a hunched appearance.</li>
            <li>Swayback: An exaggerated inward curve of the lower back, often caused by weak abdominal muscles and tight hip flexors.</li>
            <li>Flat Back: A loss of the natural curve in the lower back, which can lead to stiffness and discomfort.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>12 Exercises to Improve Your Posture</h2><br>
       <h3>A combination of yoga, stretching, and strengthening exercises may help you to fix or correct your posture over time.</h3><br>

       Maintaining good posture is important for helping you develop strength, flexibility, and balance. <br>
